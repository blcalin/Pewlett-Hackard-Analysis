### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to identify Pewlett Hackard employees nearing retirement, and employees eligible for participation in a mentorship program.

## Results and Analysis
Utilizing pgAdmin 4 and CSV through our data set, we determined the following:

 2. The Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions have the majority of eligible retirees.
 3. The Manager position does not have any retirees eligible for the Pewlett-Hackard mentorship program.

## Summary
1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Based on the results, Pewlett Hackard will face a loss of over 90,000 employees due to the "silver tsunami."
2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
Based on the number of employees eligible for retirement, there are not enough qualified, retirement-ready employees eligible to mentor. Those in the program would be taking on much more responsibility as a result.


Two additional queries/tables that may provide further insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami" include total number of positions that would be vacant by retirees, and senior-level employees by department to better determine the scale in which positons would need to be filled.
